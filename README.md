# CS-NEA-Chess
A-level CS NEA project

This is my project for my A-Level Computer Science Non Examination Assessment
Its supposed to be a chessbot (not calling it an engine because it doesnt really work like one. At least in my head rn)

Currently a work in progress. I would suggest I am about 60% the way through getting the chess board and moves set up, before I start implementing actual features
However, the parts I have left are tough, having en passant, castling, stalemates, win conditions, checks, pins, and promotions
